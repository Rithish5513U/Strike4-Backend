## Project Details

### Overview
FlowFii is a fintech platform with an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide financial insights and customer support. The platform integrates publicly available APIs to deliver personalized financial news. Users can track their finances, analyze trends, and manage a virtual investment portfolio using a user-friendly dashboard. Additionally, users can upload bank statements for automatic income and expense analysis. Our goal is to simplify financial management, empowering users to make smarter money decisions.

### Problem Statement
Develop a fintech platform prototype with an AI-powered chatbot that provides users with financial insights and customer support. The website should have a clean, user-friendly interface with a simple dashboard displaying sample financial data and a chatbot capable of handling basic FAQs related to fintech services.

### Solution
FlowFii offers an intuitive fintech platform with an AI-powered chatbot, delivering:
- **Personalized financial news** by integrating external APIs.
- **A dashboard** for users to track expenses and manage finances effectively.
- **Virtual trading and stock simulation** to educate users on trading and mutual funds.
- **AI-driven expense categorization** and financial insights from uploaded bank statements.
- **A dynamic news feed** tailored to user interests.
