## Project Details

### Overview
FlowFii is a fintech platform with an AI-powered chatbot designed to provide financial insights and customer support. The platform integrates publicly available APIs to deliver personalized financial news. Users can track their finances, analyze trends, and manage a virtual investment portfolio using a user-friendly dashboard. Additionally, users can upload bank statements for automatic income and expense analysis. Our goal is to simplify financial management, empowering users to make smarter money decisions.

### Problem Statement
Develop a basic prototype of a fintech website with an AI-powered chatbot that provides users with financial insights and customer support. The website should have a clean, user-friendly interface with a simple dashboard displaying sample financial data and a chatbot capable of handling basic FAQs related to fintech services.

### Solution

- Personalized financial news by integrating external APIs.
- A dashboard for users to track expenses and manage finances effectively.
- Virtual trading and stock simulation to educate users on trading and mutual funds.
- AI-driven expense categorization and financial insights from uploaded bank statements.
